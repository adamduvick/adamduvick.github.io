## Step 1: Gather all the ingredients

In order to make these fantastic chewy chocolate chip cookies you will need:

- **Flour**Â â€“ I always use All-Purpose flour (plain flour).
- **Butter**Â â€“ I generally use unsalted butter, but you can use salted butter. If you do, just reduce the salt that is added. Butter gives the cookies texture, and flavor, and helps with the structure.
- **Brown sugar**Â â€“ The brown sugar contains molasses which helps add moisture to the cookie. In turn, making the cookie chewier.
- **White granulated sugar**Â â€“ is an essential ingredient for making the perfect cookie.
- **Eggs**Â â€“ The eggs will add structure to the cookies as well as a bit of leavening and essential moisture.
- **Vanilla extract**Â â€“ this will add lots of flavors and enhance the flavor in the other ingredients.
- **Salt**Â â€“ Use a good table salt.
- **Baking soda**Â â€“ is the main leavening agent for the cookies.
- **Chocolate chips**Â â€“ chocolate chips are the key ingredient in chocolate chip cookies. You can use all kinds of different chocolate chips if you like.
- **Nuts**Â â€“ If you want to add another texture, you can add chopped nuts like pecans or walnuts.

## Step 2: How to make soft chewy chocolate chip cookies

![Brown and white sugar in a large bowl with butter and a mixer](https://www.inthekitchenwithmatt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/creaming-butter-and-the-sugar.webp "Brown and white sugar in a large bowl with butter and a mixer")

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. (177 C).

Then cream together the softened butter with the white and brown sugars with a hand mixer or stand mixer. Donâ€™t have a mixer? That is okay, you can use a wooden spoon.

**TIP:**Â _If your butter is not quite soft enough, go ahead and put it in the microwave for 10 to 15 seconds or place it in the oven for a little bit._

Scrape the sides of the bowl afterward to make sure everything gets mixed in.

Next, add the eggs and vanilla extract to the chewy chocolate chip cookie dough and mix until combined. Again, scrape the sides of the bowl as needed.

**NOTE**:Â _While you can leave the vanilla extract out, I donâ€™t recommend it. The vanilla adds so much flavor as well as enhances the flavor of the other ingredients._

In a separate medium bowl whisk or sift together the flour, salt, and baking soda.

Then add it about a third at a time mixing it into the main bowl. Before adding the last bit of flour, add your chocolate chips, the star of the dish. You can use whatever kind of chocolate chips that you want, I usually add semi-sweet or milk chocolate chips.

**NOTE**:Â _If you would like to add chopped nuts, you can add them at this point._

And there you go the chewy chocolate chip cookies dough is ready. The cookie dough will be nice and thick.

## Step 3: Bake those soft chewy chocolate chip cookies

![Bowl of homemade chocolate chip cookie dough](https://www.inthekitchenwithmatt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/finished-chocolate-chip-cookie-dough.webp "Bowl of homemade chocolate chip cookie dough")

Time to clean those beaters. I just use my spatula to push the dough away from the beaters.

When I was a young kid and would make cookies with my mom, cleaning the beaters was my favorite part, because she always gave me a taste. However, she never gave me quite as much as I would have liked. I donâ€™t recommend eating raw cookie dough, even though I did all the time as a kid and still do on occasion, haha.

You may bake the cookie dough now, or chill it for about 30 minutes. I donâ€™t usually have the patience to chill the dough first. If you run into an issue with them spreading really thin and flat, try chilling the dough first, it should help.

Now take a spoon or small cup or ice cream scoop, and get about 2 tablespoons worth of dough, depending on the size of the cookie that you want, and then place on your cookie sheet lined with parchment paper or anÂ [**Artisan Mat (**](http://amzn.to/2hKg1at)[**Silicone**](http://amzn.to/2hKg1at)Â [**Baking Mat)**](http://amzn.to/2hKg1at).

I absolutely love my baking mats, it lasts a super long time, is very easy to clean, and helps to prevent the cookies from burning on the bottom. Parchment paper will work great too. Read myÂ **[silicone baking mat review here](https://www.inthekitchenwithmatt.com/silicone-baking-mats-are-they-worth-it)**Â if you want.

**Bake the cookies in the oven at 350 degrees F for 10 to 16 minutes depending on the size of the cookie, start with 10 minutes and go from there.**

Bake them until you see the edges getting brown. For soft chewy chocolate chip cookies bake them for a little less time than you think.

Itâ€™s always a good idea when trying out a new cookie recipe to do a trial bake with three or four cookies, so you can get the time down.

## Step 4: Finished chocolate chip cookies

Once the cookies come out of the oven, you will notice a little browning around the edges and a bit on the tops. Let the cookies sit on your cookie sheet for about 3 more minutes, then transfer to a cookie rack to cool completely.

Serve them warm, or cool if you like. Notice the bottom of the cookie, nice brown color. ðŸ™‚ Enjoy those cookies with your friends and family!
