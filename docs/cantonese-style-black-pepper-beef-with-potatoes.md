# Cantonese-Style Black Pepper Beef with Potatoes

## Ingredients

- 3 tbsp grapeseed or other neutral oil, divided
- 3 tbsp soy sauce
- 5 medium garlic cloves, finely grated
- 4 tsp fresh ginger, finely grated
- 2 tsp cornstarch
- Kosher salt and coarsely ground black pepper
- 1 lb beef sirloin tips or tri-tip, patted dry and cut into 1-inch pieces
- 12 oz Yukon Gold potatoes, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 6 oz sweet potato, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces
- 1 medium yellow onion, chopped
- 1 red, yellow or orange bell pepper, stemmed, seeded and cut into ½-inch pieces
- 6 tbsp finely chopped fresh cilantro

## Directions

1. In a small bowl, whisk together 1 tbsp oil, soy sauce, garlic, ginger, cornstarch and 1 tsp pepper. In a medium bowl, toss the beef with 2 tbsp of this sauce mixture, then let stand at room temperature for 15 minutes. Whisk 3 tbsp water into the remaining soy sauce mixture; set aside.
2. Place both types of potatoes in a microwave-safe bowl with 1 tsp salt. Cover and microwave on high until just shy of tender (a fork should meet slight resistance), about 8 minutes, stirring halfway through. Set aside.
3. Heat 1 tbsp of the remaining oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high until shimmering. Add the beef in a single layer and cook, turning about every minute, until well-browned and the center of the thickest piece reaches 120 ℉ (for medium-rare), about 4 minutes total. Transfer to a plate.
4. In the same skillet, heat the remaining 1 tbsp oil over medium-high until shimmering. Add the potatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender and browned, about 3 minutes.
5. Add the onion and bell pepper; cook, stirring, until slightly softened, about 4 minutes.
6. Reduce heat to medium and return the beef and accumulated juices to the skillet. Pour in the reserved soy sauce mixture. Cook, folding gently, until the juices have reduced slightly and ingredients are well-coated, about 2 minutes.
7. Stir in ¼ tsp pepper and 5 tbsp of the cilantro. Transfer to a platter and sprinkle with the remaining cilantro.

**Pro Tip:** Use a wand-style grater to grate the garlic and ginger to a paste so they mix easily into the marinade and readily release their flavors. Don't chop them.
