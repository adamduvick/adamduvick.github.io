# Chocolate Doughnut Muffins

## Ingredients

**For the Muffins:**

- ½ c plus 4 tbsp (170g) unsalted butter, melted, plus more for greasing
- 2 large eggs
- 1 c (200g) granulated sugar
- 1 c (220g) sour cream
- 1 tbsp vegetable or canola oil
- 1½ tsp freshly grated nutmeg
- 1 tsp kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal), plus a pinch
- ½ c (45g) Dutch-process cocoa powder
- 1½ tsp baking powder
- ¼ tsp baking soda
- 1 c (128g) all-purpose flour
- 1 tbsp ground cinnamon

**For the Topping:**

- ¼ c (50g) granulated sugar
- 1 tbsp cinnamon
- Remaining melted butter for brushing

## Directions

1. Heat oven to 375 ℉ with a rack set in the center. Generously butter a 12-cup muffin tin.
2. In a large bowl, combine the eggs and ¾ c (150g) granulated sugar and whisk until well combined.
3. Add the sour cream, ½ c (113g) butter, the oil, nutmeg and 1 tsp salt; whisk until well combined.
4. Whisk in the cocoa powder, followed by the baking powder and the baking soda. Then use a flexible spatula to fold in the flour by gently scooping up some batter from the bottom and folding it over the flour on the top. Rotate the bowl and repeat until just incorporated.
5. Divide the mixture among the 12 wells and bake until the muffins are puffed and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with a few moist crumbs attached, 18 to 23 minutes.
6. While the muffins are baking, in a shallow bowl, combine the remaining ¼ c (50g) granulated sugar, 1 tbsp cinnamon and a pinch of salt.
7. Let the muffins cool in the pan for 5 minutes then transfer them to a rack. Working with one warm muffin at a time, brush it with some remaining melted butter then toss in the cinnamon sugar; repeat with remaining muffins.
8. Serve immediately. Store any extras in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 4 days. (The sugar will gradually melt into the muffins as they sit, but you can reroll the muffins in cinnamon sugar, if desired.)
