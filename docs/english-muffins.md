# English Muffins

## Ingredients

- 100g active sourdough starter
- 20g honey
- 240g almond milk
- 360g flour (organic Costco bread flour recommended)
- 15g salt
- Cornmeal for dusting

## Directions

### Day 1: Making the Dough

1. Combine all ingredients in a mixing bowl.
2. Cover and let rest for 30 minutes.
3. Perform 4 rounds of stretch and folds, spacing each round 30 minutes apart.
4. Cover and refrigerate overnight.

### Day 2: Shaping and Cooking

1. Remove dough from refrigerator and let come to room temperature (timing is flexible).
2. Generously sprinkle parchment paper with cornmeal.
3. Divide dough into portions of 75g each (90g for larger muffins, 100-110g for sandwich-sized).
4. For each portion:
    - Roll into a ball
    - Pinch together the underside multiple times until it holds a round shape pretty well
5. Place shaped muffins on cornmeal-dusted parchment paper.
6. Sprinkle additional cornmeal on top.
7. Cover and let rest for 2 hours or until fluffy and doubled in size.

#### Cooking

1. Preheat pan on medium-low heat (setting 4-5).
2. Place muffins in pan and cover with lid.
3. Cook for 4-5 minutes on each side.
4. Optional: After pan-frying, bake or air fry for 2-4 additional minutes to ensure they're cooked through.
5. Transfer to a cooling rack.

## Notes

- When cooled, use a fork to split the muffins (rather than a knife) to create the classic "nooks and crannies" texture.
- The larger size (100-110g) works particularly well for breakfast sandwiches.
- Recipe adapted from Little Spoon Farm's original version.
