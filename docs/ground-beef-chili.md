*By Andrew Janjigian*  
⭐ 4.0/5 (580 reviews)

## Description

Ground beef chili is convenient, but its texture is often dry and grainy. This recipe delivers both convenience and flavor using 85 percent lean ground beef. With small amounts of pureed whole tomatoes and pinto beans, it creates a thick, rich dish perfect over white rice or with tortilla chips. The meat stays moist and tender thanks to a special treatment with salt and baking soda.
