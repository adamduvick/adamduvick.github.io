# Ham and Gruyere Egg Bites

## Ingredients

- 12 large eggs
- 4 oz (1 c) Gruyère
- ½ c cottage cheese
- 2 tbsp hot sauce
- 1 tsp salt
- ¼ tsp pepper
- 4 oz (1 c) ham
- 3 stalks (¼ c) green onions

## Equipment

- blender
- pressure cooker
- silicone egg bite tray

## Instructions

1. Into a blender, crack the eggs and grate the Gruyère. Add the cottage cheese, hot sauce, salt, and pepper. Blend until smooth. Dice the ham and slice the green onions. Prepare the pressure cooker to steam for ten minutes on low pressure; add a cup of water to the pot.
2. The aim is to get twenty-one equally sized egg bites (three batches of seven bites per tray). The easiest way to do this is to divide the ham and green onions into thirds. Distribute one third of the ham into the first egg bite tray; do the same with the green onions. Pour egg mixture to fill each cup ¾s full.
3. Cover the tray with tin foil and lower it into the pressure cooker on a trivet. Steam on low pressure for 10 minutes and let the pressure naturally release for 10 more minutes. Remove and cool the covered tray upside down on a towel. Multiple trays can be stacked and cooked simultaneously (pressure-cooker-capacity permitting).
