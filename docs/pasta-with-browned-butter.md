# Pasta with Browned Butter

## Ingredients

**For the Yogurt Base**

- 6 tbsp plain whole-milk yogurt
- 1 tsp grated lemon zest
- 3 tbsp minced fresh oregano, divided
- 2 tsp sumac, divided
- Kosher salt and ground black pepper

**For the Pasta**

- 12 oz campanelle or other short pasta
- 8 tbsp (1 stick) salted butter, cut into 4 pieces
- ¼ c tomato paste
- 4 medium garlic cloves, minced
- ½ c lightly packed fresh mint, chopped
- ½ c lightly packed fresh flat-leaf parsley, chopped

## Directions

1. In a large bowl, combine yogurt, lemon zest, 2 tbsp of the oregano, 1 tsp of the sumac, 1½ tsp salt; set aside.
2. Bring 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot. Add the pasta and 2 tbsp salt; Cook until al dente. Reserve ½ c cooking water before draining.
3. Make the browned butter sauce:
  1. In a 10-inch skillet over medium heat, melt the butter.
  2. Cook while swirling until milk solids become deep golden brown and butter smells like toasted nuts (4–5 minutes).
  3. Remove from heat.
  4. Whisk in tomato paste, garlic, ½ tsp each salt and pepper.
  5. Add remaining 1 tbsp oregano and 1 tsp sumac.
  6. Mixture will appear slightly broken—this is normal.
4. Final assembly:
  1. Add pasta and reserved cooking water to the yogurt mixture.
  2. Add mint, parsley, and all but 2 tbsp of the butter mixture.
  3. Toss to coat.
  4. Transfer to serving bowl.
  5. Drizzle with remaining butter mixture.
  6. Sprinkle with additional pepper.

!!! Note
    Don't use tubed tomato paste for this recipe—it's typically double concentrated and will overwhelm the dish with tomato flavor.
