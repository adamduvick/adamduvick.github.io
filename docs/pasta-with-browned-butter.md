# Pasta with Browned Butter

## Ingredients

A Turkish-inspired pasta dish with rich browned butter sauce, adapted from a traditional manti preparation. Serves 4.
Prep Time: 30 minutes total
Ingredients

**For the Yogurt Base**

- 6 tablespoons plain whole-milk yogurt
- 1 teaspoon grated lemon zest
- 3 tablespoons minced fresh oregano, divided
- 2 teaspoons sumac, divided
- Kosher salt and ground black pepper

**For the Pasta**

- 12 ounces campanelle or other short pasta
- 8 tablespoons (1 stick) salted butter, cut into 4 pieces
- ¼ cup tomato paste
- 4 medium garlic cloves, minced
- ½ cup lightly packed fresh mint, chopped
- ½ cup lightly packed fresh flat-leaf parsley, chopped

Instructions


## Directions

In a large bowl, combine:

Yogurt
Lemon zest
2 tablespoons of the oregano
1 teaspoon of the sumac
1½ teaspoons salt
Set aside.


Bring 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot. Add:

Pasta
2 tablespoons salt
Cook until al dente. Reserve ½ cup cooking water before draining.


Make the browned butter sauce:

In a 10-inch skillet over medium heat, melt the butter
Cook while swirling until milk solids become deep golden brown and butter smells like toasted nuts (4-5 minutes)
Remove from heat
Whisk in tomato paste, garlic, ½ teaspoon each salt and pepper
Add remaining 1 tablespoon oregano and 1 teaspoon sumac
Mixture will appear slightly broken - this is normal


Final assembly:

Add pasta and reserved cooking water to the yogurt mixture
Add mint, parsley, and all but 2 tablespoons of the butter mixture
Toss to coat
Transfer to serving bowl
Drizzle with remaining butter mixture
Sprinkle with additional pepper

Note: Don't use tubed tomato paste for this recipe - it's typically double concentrated and will overwhelm the dish with tomato flavor.
