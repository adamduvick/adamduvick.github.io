# Whole Wheat Rolls

## Ingredients

- 2 packages yeast
- 1 c white flour
- ⅔ c powdered milk
- 3 tbsp sugar
- 1 tsp salt
- 2½ tbsp soft butter
- 1½ c hot water
- 3 c whole wheat flour

## Directions

1. In a large bowl, mix together the dry ingredients: yeast, white flour, powdered milk, sugar, and salt.
2. Add 2½ tbsp soft butter and 1½ c hot water. Stir until the butter melts completely.
3. Gradually stir in 3 c whole wheat flour until well combined.
4. Cover the dough and let it rise for 15 minutes.
5. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead until it no longer sticks to your hands.
6. Pat or roll the dough to approximately ¾ inch thickness.
7. Cut the dough into circles using a cookie cutter or glass.
8. Place the rolls on a greased cookie sheet and let them rise for another 15 minutes.
9. Preheat your oven to 400 ℉.
10. Bake the rolls for 10 minutes or until golden brown.

The recipe should yield several soft, wholesome whole wheat rolls. The double rising time helps develop a nice texture, while the combination of white and whole wheat flours provides both structure and nutrition.
