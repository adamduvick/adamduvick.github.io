# Slow-Cooker BBQ Pulled Chicken

## Ingredients

- 1½ c tomato-based barbecue sauce (homemade or store-bought), divided (1 c + ½ c)
- 1–2 chipotle chiles in adobo (depending on heat tolerance), plus 2 tbsp adobo sauce
- 2 tbsp Worcestershire or soy sauce
- 1½ tsp onion powder
- 1½–2 lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- 1½–2 lb boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- Salt and black pepper to taste

## Directions

### Step 1

1. In a 5- to 8-quart slow cooker, combine:
   - 1 c barbecue sauce
   - Chipotle chiles
   - Adobo sauce
   - Worcestershire sauce
   - Onion powder
2. Add the chicken (both thighs and breasts)
3. Season with salt and pepper
4. Toss to coat evenly
5. Cover and cook on low for 3–5 hours, or until the chicken shreds easily with a fork

### Step 2

1. Working directly in the slow cooker, use two forks to shred the meat into large, bite-size pieces
2. Stir in the remaining ½ c barbecue sauce
3. Season to taste with additional salt and pepper
