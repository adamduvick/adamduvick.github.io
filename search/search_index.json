Place them on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper or a\u00a0silicone mat.</p> <p></p> <p>The cookies won\u2019t spread a whole lot if any, but I usually still space them out a little bit. Make sure to ball up the cookie dough scraps and then roll them out again.</p> <p>Bake the cookies, one rack at a time, for 7 to 10 minutes. Start with 7 minutes and go from there. If you want them crunchy you will wind up baking them a little longer.</p> <p>It is always a good idea to start with just a few cookies at first so you can get the time down, before baking a ton of cookies.</p> <p></p> <p>Once the come out of the oven they won\u2019t be really dark in color just slightly more brown then before they were baked. Allow them to cool for just a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.
